# SciToday PC Web Console and ZIP Installer

## Local Web Console

Start or restart the PC backend:

```powershell
$env:RSSAI_AUTH_TOKEN = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("RSSAI_AUTH_TOKEN", "User")
.\start_server_pc.ps1 -Restart -AuthToken $env:RSSAI_AUTH_TOKEN
```

Open:

- `http://127.0.0.1:5200/admin/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5200/admin/?view=monitor`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5200/admin/?view=settings`

The web console stores the token in browser localStorage and can also receive it from
`?token=...`; the URL token is removed from browser history immediately by the page.

## New Admin APIs

- `GET /api/admin/overview`
- `GET /api/admin/events`
- `GET /api/admin/feed-health`
- `GET/POST /api/admin/settings`
- `POST /api/admin/run/rss-discovery`
- `POST /api/admin/run/rss-publish`
- `POST /api/app/heartbeat`

`/api/run/rss` remains compatible and still performs immediate discover + publish.
Scheduled PC mode now uses discovery and publish as separate jobs.

## ZIP Package Build

Build the current backend package:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\installer\build_package.ps1
```

Outputs:

- `dist\SciToday-PC-Full-V1.1.0.zip`

The release package is a transparent ZIP. It does not generate or ship a
self-extracting installer EXE. Extract the ZIP and run `install.cmd`.

The installer is per-user and writes HKCU startup entry `SciToday_admin`.
It prompts for install path, data path, local port, and auth token. Quick Tunnel
is used by default, so no domain, Named Tunnel token, or GitHub upload is required.
Existing data directories are preserved.

## Legacy PDF CLI

`pdf_watch_summarize.py` is retained for one compatibility release only. It now
delegates directly to `tasks.run_pdf_watch()` and contains no independent PDF
matching or scoring logic. External cron jobs should migrate to the backend API
or the unified task entry point.

If Windows Defender or SmartScreen blocks the tray executable, extract
`payload.zip`, open `payload\backend`, and start the backend directly with
`start_server_pc.ps1`.

## Cloudflare Quick Tunnel

The tray app starts:

```powershell
cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:5200
```

The tray app parses the generated `https://*.trycloudflare.com` URL from
`cloudflared`, writes it to `quick_tunnel.json` in the data directory, and the web
console dashboard displays the current URL and backend token for the mobile App.
